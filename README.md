Just copy the "yippee" file into your saves folder and enjoy! Currently at about 180 hours of work.\n
This is just here for me in case something happens to my worlds I put effort into and also if anyone else wants to see them \n
If ur new to github or just need help, click the green code button up to the right and click download zip, then unzip it and the yippee folder will be in there :)
